                          "a strip of squares a number of coins are placed, at most one coin per " \
                          "square. Only one coin, called the , has any value. Two players take " \
                          "turns making moves. At each turn a player must make either a or a " \
                          "move. A move consists of selecting one coin and moving it one or more " \
                          "squares to the left. The coin cannot move out of the strip or jump on " \
                          "or over another coin. Alternatively, the player can choose to make " \
                          "the move of pocketing the leftmost coin rather than making a regular " \
                          "move. If no regular moves are possible, the player is forced to " \
                          "pocket the leftmost coin. The winner is the player who pockets the " \
                          "silver dollar. A is an arrangement of coins on the strip where the " \
                          "first player can force a win no matter what the second player does. " \
                          "Let W( , ) be the number of winning configurations for a strip of " \
                          "squares, worthless coins and one silver dollar. You are given that " \
                          "W(10,2) = 324 and W(100,10) = 1514704946113500. Find W(1 000 000, " \
                          "100) modulo the semiprime 1000 036 000 099 (= 1 000 003 Â· 1 000 033)."
